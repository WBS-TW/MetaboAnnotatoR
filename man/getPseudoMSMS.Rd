difference between two consecutive low and high collision energy scans using
the information contained in xcmsF1 and xcmsF2 objects}
}
\value{
A list containing several objects: insource, all MS1 peaks related to
the feature of interest; aif, all MS2 peaks related to the feature;
ms1_peaks, all MS1 peaks at the feature RT; ms2_peaks, all MS2 peaks at the
feature RT; ms2_eic, all EICs for the AIF features in the  RT window of the
feature of interest; mz_ms2, vector of m/z values for the MS2 ions in the
RT window of the feature of interest; feic, EIC of the feature of interest.
