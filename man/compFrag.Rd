\usage{
compFrag(
  candidate,
  lib,
  fmz,
  frt,
  iso,
  highCESpec,
  pseudoSpec,
  maxMZdiff = 0.01,
  matchWeight = 0.5,
  useMZerrorWeight = TRUE,
  NoMatchWeight = 0.5,
  additional = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{candidate}{Database entry containing the candidate fragments.}

\item{fmz}{The m/z for the feature of interest.}

\item{frt}{Retention time in seconds for the feature of interest.}

\item{iso}{Isotope "tag" to add to the results.}

\item{highCESpec}{MS2 peaks at the RT window of the feature of interest.}

\item{pseudoSpec}{MS2 peaks related to the feature of interest.}

\item{maxMZdiff}{Maximum m/z difference between candidate fragments and
pseudo-MS/MS or AIF ions in Da.}

\item{matchWeight}{weight of the fragment matches to the final score;
value between 0 and 1; the remaining fraction of the weight comes from the
candidate m/z error.}

\item{useMZerrorWeight}{Logical value to indicate if the m/z error between
feature and candidate m/z is to be used for final scoring. Default is TRUE.}

\item{NoMatchWeight}{Weight to give to the additional matches between the
candidate fragments and the MS2 peaks at the RT window of the feature of
interest.}

\item{additional}{Logical value to indicate if the fragments remaining
unmatched to the pseudo-MS/MS are to be tested against the MS2 peaks at the
RT window of the feature of interest.}
}
\value{
A list containing one data frame with the summary result of the
matching of a pseudo-MS/MS and fragments of a candidate and a matrix with the
pseudo-MS/MS spectrum of matched ion fragments.
}
\description{
Function to compare pseudo-MS/MS and high-collision-energy spectra
with fragment from a candidate metabolite from the database.
