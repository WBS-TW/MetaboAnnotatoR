\title{Searches candidate metabolites from the fragments libraries by m/z}
\usage{
searchLib(libraries, libfiles, fmz, frt, tolerance = 25, RTs, inSourceSpec)
}
\arguments{
\item{libraries}{List object containing all loaded libraries.}

\item{libfiles}{Path to the libraries files.}

\item{fmz}{The m/z for the feature of interest.}

\item{frt}{Retention time in seconds for the feature of interest.}

\item{tolerance}{Tolerance for m/z candidate search in ppm.}

\item{RTs}{Optional metabolites classes Retention Times in seconds.
Default value is "none".}

\item{inSourceSpec}{Data frame containing the pseudo-MS spectrum (MS1).
This will be used to check for the "parent" ion when the feature of interest
is matched to a fragment (in-source fragment).}
}
\value{
A list of data frames containing the candidates from the fragment
libraries which will be used in the pseudo-MS/MS to fragment matching step.
}
\description{
Search candidate metabolites from the fragments libraries
for a given feature using m/z and RT (if metabolite RTs are known).
If no match is found in the "parent" ions, for instance in the case of a
feature corresponding to an in-source fragment, fragments are then searched.
Fragment ions will only be considered if the parent ion is present in the
same pseudo-MS spectrum (MS1).
