\title{Extracts the low-collision-energy (MS1) or high-collision-energy (MS2)
features (pseudo-spectra) for any feature from an XCMS output object.}
\usage{
xcmsSpec(fmz, frt, xcmsObject, mztol = 0.01, rttol = 5, highCE = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fmz}{The m/z for the feature of interest.}

\item{frt}{Retention time in seconds for the feature of interest.}

\item{xcmsObject}{Variable containing the XCMS processing object.}

\item{mztol}{Absolute tolerance for feature m/z search in Da.}

\item{rttol}{Tolerance for feature RT search in seconds.
The default (5 s) only applies to UPLC/UHPLC data.}

\item{highCE}{Logic value. If TRUE the high collision-energy is extracted,
otherwise if FALSE the "in-source" spectrum is returned.}
}
\value{
A data frame with ions (m/z and intensity) from the
high collision-energy or low collision-energy features found at the same
RT window as the feature of interest.
}
\description{
Given a feature of interest (m/z RT pair), the function will extract the
low-collision-energy (MS1) or high-collision-energy features (MS2)
at the same RT window of the feature of interest from an XCMS output object
obtained by processing both functions together from a set of LC-MS
chromatograms.
