\title{Annotation of features using LC-MS AIF datasets processed using RAMClusteR.}
\usage{
annotateRC(
  targetTable,
  xcmsObject,
  ramclustObj,
  libs = "Lipids",
  ESImode = "POS",
  RTfile = "none",
  checkIsotope = TRUE,
  tolerance = 25,
  maxMZdiff = 0.01,
  matchWeight = 0.5,
  ncandidates = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{targetTable}{A csv file containing the list of features to annotate.}

\item{xcmsObject}{XCMS object containing the processed AIF datasets.}

\item{ramclustObj}{RAMClustR object with parent-fragment reconstructions.
(clusters).}

\item{libs}{Fragment library to use: 'Lipids' (default) or 'Metabolites'
for other small molecules.}

\item{ESImode}{Ionization mode: 'POS' for positive (default) or 'NEG'
for negative ionisation modes.}

\item{RTfile}{optional csv file with Lipid/metabolites classes Retention
Times in seconds}

\item{checkIsotope}{Whether or not to check the isotope type;
default is set to TRUE.}

\item{tolerance}{Tolerance in ppm for the candidate search.}

\item{maxMZdiff}{Maximum m/z difference between candidate fragments and
pseudo-MS/MS or AIF ions in Da.}

\item{matchWeight}{weight of the fragment matches to the final score;
value between 0 and 1; the remaining fraction of the weight comes from the
candidate m/z error.}

\item{ncandidates}{Maximum number of candidates to plot and store.}
}
\value{
For each feature in the targeTable the will return a ranked list of
annotations, a plot pseudo-MS/MS spectrum for the matched ions,
a targeTable annotated with rank 1 annotations and a table with the options
used for the function.
}
\description{
Search possible matches of a feature in Lipid fragments and other
small molecule libraries.
