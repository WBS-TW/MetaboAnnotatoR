\title{Function to generate metabolite database entries from MS/MS spectra
obtained from from an .msp file}
\usage{
mspToLib(
  msp_file,
  library_name = "Custom",
  noise = 0.005,
  mpeaksScore = 0.9,
  mpeaksThres = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{msp_file}{an MS/MS spectral library for spectra from one or both polarities}

\item{library_name}{Custom library name under which POS and NEG folders will be created
and where the respective libray entries will be stored}

\item{noise}{Noise intensity threshold expressed as a ratio to the peak with
the highest intensity.}

\item{mpeaksScore}{The occurrence score to be attributed to the most intense
peaks of the MS/MS spectrum which should correspond to the most characteristic
fragmentation ions from the metabolite (or 'marker' peaks). These will be the
peaks above 'mpeaksThres' value. This score is divided by the number of peaks
above 'mpeaksThres' threshold. By default this value is defined at 0.9,
which means that peaks below 'mpeaksThres' threshold will be given an
occurrence score of 0.1, so that the sum of all fragment occurrence scores is 1.}

\item{mpeaksThres}{Intensity threshold to select peaks of the MS/MS spectrum
considered to be highest intensity, expressed as a ratio to the peak
with the highest intensity.}

\item{mzTol}{Absolute tolerance for m/z search in Da.}
}
\value{
A .csv file containing fragment and parent m/z values and corresponding
occurrence scores.
